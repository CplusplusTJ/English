	我小时候，我以为这个动物城是完美的地方.人人和谐相处,谁都能成为无限可能.
	现在发现，现实远比宣传口号要复杂，现实生活是糟糕的.
	我们都有局限性，都会犯错，但是乐观来说，我们也都很像.
	我们越是努力了解别人，越会变得出色，但凡事都要尝试.
	不管你是什么类型的动物，从巨大的大象警官到第一只狐狸警官.
	我恳请你们，努力尝试，让世界变得更美好，审视自己的内心.
	从现在开始，从为做起，从我们做起。











	When I was a kid,I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.Where everyone 	got along,and anyone could be anything.
	Turns out,real life is a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker.Real life is messy.
	We all have limitations,we all make mistakes,Which means,hey,glass half ful,we all have a lot in common,And the more we try to understand one another.
	The more exceptional each of us will be.But we have to try.
	So no matter what type of animal you are.From the biggest elephant,to our 
first fox.I implore you.Try...Try to make the world a better place,Look inside 
yourself and recognize that change starts with you.It starts with me.It starts 
with all of us.
